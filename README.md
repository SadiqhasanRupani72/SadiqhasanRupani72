### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Form India!, my name is Sadiqhasan, and I'm currently a student studying Web Development and Database Management. I appreciate studying languages and frameworks such as ReactJS, NodeJS, Bootstrap, and TypeScript, as well as databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I also like creating interactive websites with features. You can check out my twitter at twitter.com/sh_rupani_1 or https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadiqhasan-rupani-a50730175/.
